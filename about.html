                <p>Welcome to SamThing Baked, where passion meets the oven! What started as a simple hobby quickly grew into a beloved brand that has captured the hearts of our customers. Established in 2015, SamThing Baked began as an online business, offering customized cakes and pastries tailored to individual tastes and preferences.</p>
                <p>Our journey began with two professionals from different fields—a statistician and a businessman in the IT industry—who decided to take a leap of faith and turn their shared love for baking into a full-time venture. This dream soon blossomed into something much bigger, and in June 2024, we proudly opened our first physical store in Bulacan. Since then, we have continued to grow, bringing our freshly baked goods to more communities with new locations at Adamson University (November 2024) and Mapúa University-Makati (February 2025). We remain committed to delivering quality pastries and cakes that bring joy to every occasion.</p>
